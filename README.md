# POneStarwars

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.

Purpose of this project is to learn angular 2. This project has followed a tutorial to get the results as 
it is my first path on the road to angular 2 learnings. 

One thing to note is there are different branchs exploring different angular mechanism such as obervables, 
error handling, loading, async pipe and so on.
